#What is the syntax to use switch-case in Python. Given an example.


  Python does not have a built-in switch-case statement like some other languages (e.g., C, Java). 
  However, you can achieve similar functionality using a dictionary of functions or if-elif-else statements. 
  Since Python 3.10, you can also use the match-case statement, which is Python's implementation of pattern matching and can be used similarly to a switch-case.

  
  example: def switch_case_example(value):
    match value:
        case 1:
            return "One"
        case 2:
            return "Two"
        case 3:
            return "Three"
        case _:
            return "Default case"

print(switch_case_example(2))  # Output: Two

    Example using if-elif-else: 

              def switch_case_example(value):
    if value == 1:
        return "One"
    elif value == 2:
        return "Two"
    elif value == 3:
        return "Three"
    else:
        return "Default case"

# Example usage
print(switch_case_example(2))  # Output: Two

Each approach allows you to achieve similar behavior to a switch-case structure. 
The match-case statement is the most direct translation in modern Python, whereas the other methods provide more flexibility and backward compatibility.
