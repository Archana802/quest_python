# Why there is no implicit type casting in Python ?

Python's design philosophy emphasizes explicitness and readability. 
Implicit type casting can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, making code harder to understand 
and debug. By requiring explicit type conversions, Python ensures:

1. Clarity: Code clearly shows intended conversions, reducing ambiguity.
2. Safety: Prevents unintended type changes, reducing errors.
3. Flexibility: Allows developers to choose appropriate conversion methods.
