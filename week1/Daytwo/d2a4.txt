#What is the difference between @static method and @class method?


  In Python, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are both decorators used to define methods within classes, but they differ in their behavior and usage:

`@staticmethod`:

1. No access to class or instance: A static method doesn't take `self` (instance) or `cls` (class) as an argument.
2. Just a utility function: It's essentially a function that's grouped with the class for organizational purposes.
3. No inheritance: Static methods are not inherited by subclasses.

`@classmethod`:

1. Access to class: A class method takes `cls` (the class itself) as the first argument.
2. Inheritance: Class methods are inherited by subclasses.
3. Alternative constructor: Often used as an alternative constructor or factory method.

Key differences:

- Access to class or instance
- Inheritance behavior
- Purpose (utility function vs. class-related operation)

When to use each:

- `@staticmethod`: For utility functions that don't interact with the class or instance.
- `@classmethod`: For methods that interact with the class itself, like alternative constructors or class-level operations.
