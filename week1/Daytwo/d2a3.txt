#Why there is no ++ and -- (increment/decrement) operators in Python?


  Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, 
  deliberately omitted the ++ and -- operators for several reasons:

1. Readability: The operators can make code harder to read, especially for those unfamiliar with C-style syntax.
2. Simplicity: Python aims for simplicity and consistency, and these operators can lead to complex expressions.
3. Avoiding side effects: ++ and -- have side effects, modifying the variable in place, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4. Focusing on high-level operations: Python emphasizes high-level, abstract thinking, making increment and decrement operations less relevant.

Instead, Python uses `a += 1` and `a -= 1` for increment and decrement, which are more explicit and readable
