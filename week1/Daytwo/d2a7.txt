#Can the key within a dictionary be a composite value like a list or tuple, or should it be an atomic value such as number or string?


  In Python, dictionary keys can be any immutable type, including:

1. Atomic types: numbers (int, float), strings, bytes, booleans
2. Tuples: immutable collections of values
3. Frozensets: immutable sets

However, dictionary keys cannot be:

1. Lists: mutable collections of values
2. Dictionaries: mutable mappings
3. Sets: mutable sets
4. Custom class instances: unless they are immutable and hashable

Tuples and frozensets can be used as keys because they are immutable and hashable,
meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation and they can be used in a hash table (which dictionaries are implemented as).

For example:

`my_dict = {(1, 2): 'value1', ('a', 'b'): 'value2'}`

But, you cannot use a list as a key:

`my_dict = {[1, 2]: 'value1'}`  # raises a TypeError

If you need to use a composite value as a key, consider converting it to a tuple or frozenset, 
or use a different data structure, like a list of dictionaries.
