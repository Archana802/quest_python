#learn list slicing and list comprehension

1. List Slicing
List slicing allows you to extract parts of a list by specifying a range of indices. The syntax for slicing is:

list_name[start:stop:step]


start: The index to begin the slice (inclusive). Defaults to 0 if omitted.
stop: The index to end the slice (exclusive). Defaults to the length of the list if omitted.
step: The interval between elements. Defaults to 1 if omitted.

2. List Comprehension
List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists. 

expression: The expression that generates each item.
item: The variable that takes the value of each element in the iterable.
iterable: The collection (like a list) that youâ€™re iterating over.
condition (optional): A filter that only includes items where the condition is True.
