print(file:SupportsWrite[str]) : The file argument in the print() function in Python specifies 
where the output of the print() function should go. By default, print() sends its output to sys.stdout, 
which typically means the console or terminal. However, by using the file argument, 
you can redirect the output to a different stream, such as a file or 
any other object that implements a write() method.

sorted()
iterable: Iterable[SupportsRichComparisonT@sorted], /, *, key: None = None, 
reverse: bool = False) -> list[SupportsRichComparisonT@sorted]

 -   The key argument is set to len, which is a built-in function that returns the length of a string. 
The list words will be sorted based on the length of each word.
 -   The reverse argument is a boolean that specifies whether the sorting should be in ascending order (default) or 
 descending order. If reverse=True, the sorted order is reversed (i.e., descending).
 -   iterable: It specifies the collection of items to be sorted, such as a list, tuple, or any iterable.

iterable: The collection of items to be sorted (required).
key: A function that defines the sorting criteria (optional).
reverse: A boolean that determines whether to sort in descending order (optional).
